St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Community in northwest Raleigh and Lincoln Park Holiness Church in southeast Raleigh crossed faith, socioeconomic and geographic barriers to form a partnership. Itâ€™s amazing what can happen when we put differences aside for the greater good!
This partnership formed what is known today as Passage Home. For all of our differences, nothing could keep us from the common bond we shared to make a positive change in the lives of our fellow Wake County citizens struggling to put food on the table for themselves and their families.
